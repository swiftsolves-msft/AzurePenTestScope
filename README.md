=================

 

**Avoid BlackBox testing** when conducting a Azure Penetration Test against your
applications or your organization.

 

The following scripts and programs are to help security professionals scope
their organizations Azure footprint prior to penetration testing to avoid
BlackBox testing scenarios that can lead to inadvertent cross organization creep
in a multi tenant service like Azure.

If you are new to Azure Penetration testing please review the following
[Article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-pen-testing),
while Microsoft is permissive of pen testing types especially port scanning /
fuzzing. If going beyond basics it is always best to notify Microsoft via [Pen
Test Form](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/pentest) and wait for
acknowledgment and approval before proceeding.

Finally I highly recommend checking out the book [Pentesting Azure
Applications](https://nostarch.com/azure) by Matt Burrough. Within the chapters
Matt goes into other concepts beyond just the network focusing on identity
planes and authentication and authorization in Azure.

Please also see [Azure Management
Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management-groups-overview)
to gain Read level access across Azure Subscriptions current and future ones
that need to be reported on.

Happy PenTesting !
