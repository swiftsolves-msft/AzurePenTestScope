If you are new to Azure Penetration testing please review the following
[Article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-pen-testing),
while Microsoft is permissive of pen testing types especially port scanning /
fuzzing. If going beyond basics it is always best to notify Microsoft via [Pen
Test Form](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/pentest) and wait for
acknowledgment and approval before proceeding.

 

Finally I highly recommend checking out the book [Pentesting Azure
Applications](https://nostarch.com/azure) by Matt Burrough. Within the chapters
Matt goes into other concepts beyond just the network focusing on identity
planes and authentication and authorization in Azure.

 

Happy PenTesting !
